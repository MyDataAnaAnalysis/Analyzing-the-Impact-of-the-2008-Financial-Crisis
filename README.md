# Introduction
The global financial crisis of 2008 was a pivotal event in the history of financial markets. It reshaped the global economy, with banks and financial institutions at the epicenter of the turmoil. This project aims to explore how major U.S. bank stocks performed before, during, and after the crisis, providing insights into their recovery and resilience. By focusing on the stock prices of some of the largest financial institutions, we can gain a better understanding of the impact the crisis had on the banking sector, as well as how these banks rebounded in the following years.

The analysis will focus on the stock performance of six key banks:

- Bank of America
- CitiGroup
- Goldman Sachs
- JPMorgan Chase
- Morgan Stanley
- Wells Fargo
  
This study will serve as a way to track the trajectory of these banks during a period of extreme volatility and uncertainty, from the crisis up until late 2023.

# Overview
In this exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will gather historical stock price data for the selected banks from 2006 to 2016. By utilizing this data, we will perform the following:

- Data Collection: We will extract the stock price data using APIs such as pandas_datareader, which will allow us to pull historical data from reliable sources like Yahoo Finance.

- Data Visualization: Through visualizations such as time-series plots, rolling statistics, and correlation heatmaps, we will explore the general trends of these stocks and any significant events that influenced their behavior.

- Crisis Analysis: Special emphasis will be placed on analyzing how these stocks behaved during the 2008 financial crisis, identifying sharp declines and recovery patterns.

- Comparison of Banks: By comparing stock performance across different banks, we will identify which institutions were more resilient and which struggled, drawing insights into their risk management and business models.

- Trend Analysis Post-Crisis: We will also explore the performance of these banks from 2009 to early 2016, providing insights into their recovery, growth, and any external factors that may have influenced their stock prices.

Through this analysis, we hope to understand the broader market dynamics and the specific impacts on individual banks. By leveraging historical data and conducting thorough visual and statistical analysis, we aim to draw meaningful conclusions about the financial crisis's effects on the banking sector and their subsequent recovery.
